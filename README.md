# FLL Scrimmage Display

This webpage is designed to serve as the main projected display for the [FIRST LEGO League (FLL)](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/) scrimmage hosted and organized by the [Brookline Robotics Initiative](https://www.brooklinerobotics.org/). The goal is to provide a timer for the robot game matches and an overview of the match schedule, including highlighting the teams competing in the current match along with the teams next up in the queue for the subsequent matches.

## Implementation

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Accessibility
- [Pico](https://picocss.com/) - default styling
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - icons
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/) - sound effects
- [Fluid Style](https://fluid.style/) - fluid typography calculator

### Continued development

Known issues (specific areas that the solution should be improved):

- [x] The match schedule table gets crowded at middle viewport sizes. Hide a column and/or transition to a one-column format sooner.
- [ ] In the match schedule table, there is a transparent border spacing around the cells that allows user to see the cells underneath the header as the table is scrolled up vertically.
- [ ] The game over sound effect doesn't play on iPhone Safari or Chrome (but does on Firefox). Investigate on a different device to see if this is a caching issue, or some other problem.

Feature requests (enhancements to consider making) ðŸ¤”:

- [x] Change Pico color scheme (see [Pico > Version Picker > Theme color](https://picocss.com/docs/version-picker/))
- [x] Combine the start and play buttons so the 3-2-1-LEGO! countdown is done automatically.
- [x] Include sound to indicate both the start of the timer (the LEGO!) and the end of the timer (Time's up!).
- [x] Have option to read in a default CSV match schedule file.
- [ ] Improve styling of the current match section, especially better highlighting of the current match number.
- [ ] Add an on-deck or next-up-in-the-queue to the current match section.
- [ ] Open a full-display alert dialog when the timer has completed.
- [ ] Style the timer to be a different color (or some other visual indicator) as the timer gets close to 0 (possibly the last 10 seconds).
- [ ] Include an audio countdown (or some other audio indicator) as the timer gets close to 0 (possibly the last 10 seconds).
- [ ] Add a progress bar for the timer countdown progress.
- [ ] Have a dropdown for different sound effect choices.
