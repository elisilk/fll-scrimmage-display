# FLL Scrimmage Display

This webpage is designed to serve as the main projected display for the [FIRST LEGO League (FLL)](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/) scrimmage hosted and organized by the [Brookline Robotics Initiative](https://www.brooklinerobotics.org/). The goal is to provide a timer for the robot game matches and an overview of the match schedule, including highlighting the teams competing in the current match along with the teams next up in the queue for the subsequent matches.
